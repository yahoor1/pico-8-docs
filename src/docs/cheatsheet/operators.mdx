### Bitwise
```
x & y   -- both bits are set
x | y   -- either bit is set
x ^^ y  -- either bit is set, but not both of them
~ x     -- each bit is not set
x << n  -- shift left n bits (zeros come in from the right)
x >> n  -- arithmetic right shift (the left-most bit state is duplicated)
x >>> n -- logical right shift (zeros comes in from the left)
x <<> n -- rotate all bits in x left by n places
x >>< n -- rotate all bits in x right by n places
```

### Bitwise functions
```
band(x, y) -- both bits are set
bor(x, y)  -- either bit is set
bxor(x, y) -- either bit is set, but not both of them
bnot(x)    -- each bit is not set
shl(x, n)  -- shift left n bits (zeros come in from the right)
shr(x, n)  -- arithmetic right shift (the left-most bit state is duplicated)
lshr(x, n) -- logical right shift (zeros comes in from the left)
rotl(x, n) -- rotate all bits in x left by n places
rotr(x, n) -- rotate all bits in x right by n places
```

### Assignment
```
a = b -- set
a + b -- sum
a - b -- sub
a * b -- mul
a / b -- div
a \ b -- int div; ie: flr(x)/n
a % b -- mod
a ^ b -- pow
```

### Augmented Assignment
```
a += b -- sum to
a -= b -- sub to
a *= b -- mul to
a /= b -- div to
a %= b -- mod to
a ^= b -- pow to
```

### Relational
```
a == b -- equivalent
a ~= b -- non-equivalent
a != b -- non-equivalent
a > b  -- greater
a < b  -- less
a >= b -- greater or equivalent
a <= b -- less or equivalent
```

### Boolean
```
not a   -- negation
a and b -- conjunction
a or b  -- disjunction
```

### Delimiters
```
(a)
```
