The stat() function returns information about the current runtime environment.
Each kind of information has an ID (a number), described below.

```lua
stat(4) -- clipboard; after user pressed ctrl-v
stat([16..19]) -- index of playing sfx on channels [0..3]
stat([20..23]) -- note number (0..31) on channels [0..3]
stat(30) -- keyboard key hit; see "peek / poke" tab
stat(31) -- keyboard character; see "peek / poke" tab
stat(32) -- mouse x coord; see "peek / poke" tab
stat(33) -- mouse y coord; see "peek / poke" tab
stat(34) -- mouse button bitmask; see "peek / poke" tab
```

```lua
stat(0) --[[ Memory Usage
The number returned is a value in Kilobytes, with 1 representing 1024 bytes.
Any decimal value returned is accurate, for example, 1.875 is equivalent to 1920 bytes.

This value accounts for ANY & ALL data used in the Lua code, including variables and tables, etc.
Thus, the maxiumum amount this can return is 2048, ie, 2 Megabytes, the total amount of memory alloted to Lua.

This value does NOT include any peekable/pokeable RAM, ie, graphical/video, nor does it include the cart ROM.

stat(1) --[[ Total CPU Usage
Initializes at 0 from the first _update call after the most recent _draw call.
The value will increment steadily towards 1 as the next frame approaches.

Ultimately, if the _update function is used, a value of 1 would represent 1/30th of a second having elapsed.
If instead the _update60 function is used, a value of 1 would represent 1/60th of a second instead.

Any time this returns a value exceeding 1 is an indication that the current cart is beyond the processing power it
is allotted for that frame. This means that frames will likely be dropped to compensate for the slow down.

stat(2) --[[ System CPU Usage
This value represents the the range/behavior seen in stat(1)

The difference between the two is that this value will only increase when PICO-8 is processing unseen code.

For example, if the screen was cleared 70 times in a step, stat(2) would return a value > 1. 
That's because the cls() function is a system call, but if the frame was spent calculating PI,
stat(2) wouldn't rise, as such calculations are not system calls.
