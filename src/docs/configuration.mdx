## config.txt
	
You can find some settings in config.txt. Edit the file when PICO-8 is not running.
	
- Windows: `C:/Users/Yourname/AppData/Roaming/pico-8/config.txt`
- OSX: `/Users/Yourname/Library/Application Support/pico-8/config.txt`
- Linux: `~/.lexaloffle/pico-8/config.txt`

Use the -home switch (below) to use a different path to store config.txt and other data.
		
- Some settings can be changed while running PICO-8 by typing `CONFIG SETTING VALUE`.
- type `CONFIG` by itself for a list

-accept_future n         use 1 to allow loading cartridges made with future versions of PICO-8
```

## Controller Setup

PICO-8 uses the SDL2 controller configuration scheme. It will detect common controllers startup
on startup and also looks for custom mappings in sdl_controllers.txt in the same directory 
as config.txt. sdl_controllers.txt has one mapping per line.

To generate a custom mapping string for your controller, use either the controllermap
program that comes with SDL2, or try http://www.generalarcade.com/gamepadtool/

To find out the id of your controller as it is detected by SDL2, search for "joysticks"
or "Mapping" in log.txt after running PICO-8. This id may vary under different operating
systems. See: https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=32130
	
To set up which keyboard keys trigger joystick buttons presses, use `KEYCONFIG`.

## Screenshots, Videos and Cartridge Labels

While a cartridge is running use:

- `CTRL+6` Save a screenshot to desktop
- `CTRL+7` Capture cartridge label image
- `CTRL+8` Start recording a video
- `CTRL+9` Save GIF video to desktop (8 seconds by default)
	
- You can save a video at any time (it is always recording); CTRL-8 simply resets the video
starting point. To record more than 8 seconds, use the CONFIG command (maximum: 120)

```CONFIG GIF_LEN 60```

- If you would like the recording to reset every time (to create a non-overlapping sequence), use:

```CONFIG GIF_RESET_MODE 1```

The gif format can not match 30fps exactly, so PICO-8 instead uses the closest match: 33.3fps.

If you have trouble saving to the desktop, try configuring an alternative desktop path in config.txt
